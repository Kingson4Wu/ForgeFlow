# Bandit configuration file
# This file configures Bandit to ignore certain security checks that are
# either false positives or are acceptable risks in our specific use case.

# Skip B110 (try_except_pass) - We intentionally use pass in exception handlers
# when we want to continue execution without taking action
# Skip B112 (try_except_continue) - We intentionally use continue in exception
# handlers to continue rule evaluation
# Skip B404 (blacklist_imports) - We import subprocess but use it safely with
# hardcoded command lists
# Skip B603 (subprocess_without_shell_equals_true) - We intentionally avoid shell=True
# for security, using hardcoded command lists instead
# Skip B607 (start_process_with_partial_path) - We use hardcoded command names that
# are expected to be on PATH, which is acceptable in our use case

# List of test IDs to skip
skips: ['B110', 'B112', 'B404', 'B603', 'B607']

# Exclude specific files or directories from scanning
exclude_dirs: ['.git', '__pycache__', '.venv', 'venv']

# Set the severity level for which Bandit will exit with a non-zero exit code
# (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
severity: LOW

# Set the confidence level for which Bandit will exit with a non-zero exit code
