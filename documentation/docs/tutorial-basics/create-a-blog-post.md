Learn how we used ForgeFlow to automatically fix failing tests in our project.

We set up ForgeFlow with the fix_tests task to monitor our test suite and automatically address failures. The system now handles:

- Detection of failing tests
- Analysis of error messages
- Generation of fixes using AI assistance
- Verification of fixes

This has reduced our manual test fixing time by 70%!
```

A new automation story is now available for the community.

title: Custom Rules for Web Development Projects

    title: Web Developer
    url: https://github.com/your-username
tags: [rules, web-development, customization]
---

We developed custom rules specifically for web development projects that handle:

- CSS/HTML validation issues
- JavaScript linting problems  
- Frontend framework compatibility
- Performance optimization suggestions

Our rules look for specific patterns in AI output and respond with targeted commands for web development tasks.
```

Sharing your experiences helps the community improve their own automation workflows.
